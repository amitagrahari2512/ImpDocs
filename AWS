AWS :

--Login with CLI :

aws configure --profile nagp
Enter Access Id
Enter Secret Access Key
Enter region

--Get S3 bucket list:

aws s3 ls

if you have multiple profile so we need to use --profile <ProfileName>

aws s3 ls --profile nagp

--create s3 bucket from CLI


aws s3 mb s3://amittestaws

aws s3 mb s3://amittestaws --region ap-south-1

aws s3 mb s3://amittestaws --profile nagp

---Roles

For service to service communication 

---Policies

For particualar resource we can create own policy


---storage categories:

1 - Object Storage - (S3) - (--work on http protocol)
2 - File Storage - (EFS) - ex: software directory  (-- Work on other protocol)
3 - Block Storage - (EBS) - (Volume) - ex: hard drive associate with system 

---Create Volume

it is block storage


---Terra Form:

1- terraform init
2- terraform plan - Tell What this terra form can do
3- terraform apply -auto-approve
4- terraform destroy

5- terrafprm fmt fileNmae.tf 

NOTE - .tfstate file conains output for micro services returned

---VPC

172.31.0.0/16

Ip range has - 32 bits = 16 means we are fixing 16 bits and rest 16 bit we can use
so 2 pow 16  = 65536 , So we have
2 pow 36 -1 Ip range = 65536-1 = 65535


--- Create VPC Process

1 - Create Vpc
2 - Create Internet Gateway
3 - create Route Table
4 - Create Subnet
5 - Associate Subnet to Route Table	

6 - NatGateway - When private subnet ,want to communicate with outside world, then we need to create nat gateway for this,
	After Nat Gateway private subnet can communicate with outside world, but outside world cannot connect with private subnet,
	This is the beauty of NAT Gateway.

7 - peer vpc communication - when two different region vpc wants to connect, then use Peer communication,nd change route table accordingly.
	Two VPC can have same cidr range,
	But when we do peer vpc communication, then cidr range should be diffrent.



---

Max 5-VPC in One Region(1 - default , 4 - more we can create)

For VPC we need to create a Subnet 

Security Group is associated with Vpc

Vpc needsds to connect with internet gateway

1 Internet gateway attached with atmost one VPC


--- Can 2 VPC connect through Private IP?

Yes It can but we need to use VPC Pering concept, 

Or else we need to use internet gatway for communication


---- Routes

Without routes VPC is not working, because we haven't describe which is working on internet gateway
Routes have  2 entity:

1 - VPC IPs - it is showing that those IPs are local ip and this can be communicated without internet gateway.

2 - 0.0.0.0/0 - It is showing any IP from this range apart from (VPC IPs )from outside word can be go through with in Internet gateway.

3 - Subnet must be associate with Internet gateway
