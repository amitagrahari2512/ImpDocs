1 - NOde Js :

V8 engine - written in C++
Libraries - Written in C++

Node js : written in Js

2- Event Driven programming:

3- Blocking and Non Blocking I/O :

4 - Node Js is popular just because it is too much fast(performance) apart from javaScript : Pros :
	LightWeight
	Client and Server code is same (JavaScript code).

5 - We remove thread concept in Node Js with the help of event driven programming.

6 - Event Loop - It is a suite which can pool events, It is running in multithreaed environment.

7 - Node Js is single threaded, But it is half truth,actually it is event driven and single-threaded with background workers.

8 - Libuv - It is library that provides the event loop in Node Js.

9 - V8 + NodeApi + Libuv = Node.js

10 - Node Js cons : 
		When we are processing CPU intensive Task - like image processing
		Intelligence - LIke we will not get error on development time or something while dev like JavaScript issue.
		Using Relational Database with Node.js is pain.
		Every time using a callback end up with tons of nested callbacks.
		
11 - Node Js - Primitive types
	String
	Number
	Boolean
	Undefined
	Null
	
	Support loose couple in var
	
12 -RAPL mode : for cmd in Node , Just write NODE and this will work

13- process.argv

14 - Callback
15 - CallBack Hell
16 - Promise

17 - Local Modules

18 - We have two types of dependency in pcakage.json , like dev and prod ?
19 - Can we download only one dependency at a time ?

20 - Module Pattern - It is working on caching pattern so it can import modules and put it in caching,So it can not download modules every time,
 We can close it manually.
 
21- Events and Events Emitters
	Create Events - eventEmitter.on()
	Run Events - eventEmitter.emit()
	Remove Events - eventEmitter.removeListner()
	
22 - Express : 
	22.1 - It is a framework to create minimal and flexible Node.js web application Framework.
			It supports multiple templating engine like jade, handlebar, ejs
			install - npm install -g express-generator
			create app - express --git --view -ejs newexpressapp
	
	22.2 - Middleware - to route our request in specify path
	22.3 - Handler - on the basis of redirection code is running (It is where we write our business logic)
	22-4 - View Engines - express also provides view engine like ejs and all.
	

23 - Web Sockets : 
24 - Socket.IO : Broadcast - No broadcast to same person who want's to broadcast
		socket.on - create function
		io.sockets.emit - listen the events
		
25 - launch.json - For Debugging we need to use launch.json

26 - Streams
27 - FileHandling
28 - Authentication and Authorization
29 - Session 
30 - Interaction With Db

#####Same singelton pattern in multiple server,then how it will react?
